Meteoric Daisy Patient Client Design Doc, v1.0

1) Rationale/Overview
The app's interface should be as simple and convenient as possible.
Buttons, animations should be kept to a minimum, and medical information 
takes priority.

2) App Screens/States
	2.0 User Login Screen
	The app's initial log-in screen. The patient's account is created by
	the medical staff's administrative interface. The account is identified
	by an email address provided by the patient, along with a randomly generated
	password. An email containing these credentials will be sent to the user.
	Upon first login, the user will be prompted to set their own password.

	This screen provides only a log-in button and a password reset feature.
	Note that the password reset link will not be displayed/functional if the
	user has not logged in once and changed their randomly assigned password.
	Transitions: 2.1

	2.1 Index/Home Page
	Displays a list of the patient's upcoming appointments; each item
	contains a "right arrow" to switch to a details page.

	Transitions: 2.0, 2.2

	2.2 Appointment Details Page
	Provides:
		-More detailed appointment location
		-Preparation checklist

	There is a back button to return to the appointment list.

	There are 3 buttons on the bottom of this page for 3 actions the
	user can perform, specific to this appointment. Each button will
	trigger a backdrop/popup prompting the user for the task. Tap again
	to cancel/remove the prompt.
		-Update Status: 
		
		send the current status of the preparation checklist 
		to the staff program. Updates the "checked/unchecked" status of the current appointment. 
		Returns a prompt to the user indicating whether or not the operation succeeded.
		The updated state will be reflected on the medical staff's management application, and
		they will also receive a notification.

		users are not allowed to "retroactively" change/update the status of overdue or expired checklist items.
		for example, if a certain obligation was due at May 30, 2015, 4:00PM, that checkbox will be grayed out
		when the user revists the app past that time. 
		
		-Contact: Bring up contact details of staff associated with
		-Info: Bring up information on this appointment's medical procedure

	Transitions: 2.1, 2.2

3) Push Notifications
	MDaisy push notifications take two forms, one for an appointment reminder, and the other
	for a specific appointment's obligation reminder.

	let patient_record stand in for a document from the Meteor.user collection
	let patient_apt stand in for that user's corresponding appointment from the appointments collection
	let patient_obligation stand in for an obligation related to patient_apt from the preparations collection

	An appointment reminder has the following form:
		"Hi <patient_record.profile[name]>, you have an upcoming appointment: 
		<patient_apt.proc_type> on <patient_apt.date> at <patient_apt.location>."

	These reminders are sent 24 hours before the actual date of the appointment.

	An obligation reminder has the following form:
		"Hi <patient_record.profile[name]>, remember to: <patient_obligation.text> for 
		your appointment: <patient_apt.proc_type> on <patient_apt.date>."

	These reminders are sent 1 hour before the actual required date of the preparation.

	Furthermore, push notifications are only received by a user if they are currently logged into the MDaisy
	app and the app is either running in the foreground or background. 

=======================
	Staff control appointments. the back button now requires a login before successful redirect.
	once selected, back/forward buttons can't be used to get to the appointment list.
