<h3>What can I expect on the day of my appointment?</h3>\
<p>When you arrive in our office, you will be asked to verify your identification and exam. Patient verification is an important part of your safety and you will be asked to verify your identification several times during your appointment. Our check-in staff will ask you to complete registration forms that will allow us to collect your medical history and any necessary insurance information. One of our technologists will then escort you to the changing area and review your medical history. You may be asked to remove hairpins, jewelry, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and any removable dental work, depending on the part of the body that is being scanned. </p>\
<p>You will be positioned on a table and moved through the CT machine so that we are able to acquire the necessary images. You may hear humming sounds during the procedure as the x-ray tube and detectors rotate. You may be asked to hold your breath for certain studies to ensure clear images.</p>\
<p>Some CT scans require the use of an iodinated contrast material, also known as "x-ray dye." Depending on the type of study, you may receive contrast orally, intravenously, or both. Oral contrast may be given one to two hours prior to the actual examination to allow distribution through your bowel. Intravenous (IV) contrast is given at the time of the \
examination. If IV contrast is required, a skilled nurse or technologist will start the IV, usually in the arm or hand, prior to the examination. The IV will be removed immediately afterward. </p>';
