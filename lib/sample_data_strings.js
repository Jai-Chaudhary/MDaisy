<h3>During scheduling and prior to your exam:</h3>\
<p>Please notify our staff when scheduling your appointment AND when checking in for your appointment if any of the following apply to you:</p>\
<ul>\
	<br/><li>If there is any possibility that you are pregnant.</li>\
	<br/><li>If you are allergic to contrast.</li>\

</ul>\
\
</br>\
<h3>How should I prepare for the procedure?</h3>\
<ul>\
	<br/><li>Wear something that is comfortable and easy to remove. For most scans you will be asked to change into a gown. Metal objects interfere with the image quality so avoid clothing with zippers or snaps.</li>\
	<br/><li>Intravenous contrast exams: No food or liquids two (2) hours prior to exam. You will receive an injection of X-ray dye at the time of the exam. Please arrive 15 minutes before your exam time. </li>\
	<br/><li>Oral contrast exams: No food or liquids two (2) hours prior to exam. You will be given oral contrast to drink approximately two (2) hours prior to the exam. Please arrive two (2) hours before your exam time.  </li>\
	<br/><li>CT Colonography (Virtual Colonoscopy): Patients should follow the instructions regarding fasting (NO FOOD), clear fluids and the bowel cleansing preparation prescribed by their doctor. It is important that the patient follow his/her doctorâ€™s instructions before the exam. </li>\
	<br/><li>If on Chemotherapy, Metformin, or Glucophage: It is recommended that BUN and creatinine blood levels be obtained by your primary care physician and the results be forwarded to Weill Cornell Imaging prior to exam (lab work must be done within one (1) week of CT scan</li>\
	<br/><li>Diabetic Patients: If on oral hypoglycemic such as Glucophage, you should stop these agents for 48 hours after the CT scan if you received intravenous (IV) contrast. </li>\
</ul>\
\

<h3>It is important that you bring the following with you on the day of your appointment: </h3>\
<ul>\
	<br/><li>A copy of the prescription for your examination if it was given to you.</li>\
	<br/><li>A list of your current medications. </li>\
	<br/><li>Your insurance information.</li>\
</ul>\

</br>\
<h3>What can I expect on the day of my appointment?</h3>\
<p>When you arrive in our office, you will be asked to verify your identification and exam. Patient verification is an important part of your safety and you will be asked to verify your identification several times during your appointment. Our check-in staff will ask you to complete registration forms that will allow us to collect your medical history and any necessary insurance information. One of our technologists will then escort you to the changing area and review your medical history. You may be asked to remove hairpins, jewelry, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and any removable dental work, depending on the part of the body that is being scanned. </p>\
<p>You will be positioned on a table and moved through the CT machine so that we are able to acquire the necessary images. You may hear humming sounds during the procedure as the x-ray tube and detectors rotate. You may be asked to hold your breath for certain studies to ensure clear images.</p>\
<p>Some CT scans require the use of an iodinated contrast material, also known as "x-ray dye." Depending on the type of study, you may receive contrast orally, intravenously, or both. Oral contrast may be given one to two hours prior to the actual examination to allow distribution through your bowel. Intravenous (IV) contrast is given at the time of the \
examination. If IV contrast is required, a skilled nurse or technologist will start the IV, usually in the arm or hand, prior to the examination. The IV will be removed immediately afterward. </p>';

Our check-in staff will ask you to complete registration forms that will allow us to collect your medical history and any necessary insurance information.

You will be asked to remove and place your electronic devices, wallet, ATM/credit cards, metro-card, watch, jewelry, belt, hairpins, eyeglasses, hearing aid, or any removable dental work into the provided lockers.</p>\
<p>Some MRI examinations require the use of contrast material. If contrast is required, a skilled nurse or technologist will start an intravenous (IV), usually in the arm or hand, prior to the examination. The IV will be removed immediately afterward.</p>\
<p>Before you enter the MRI scanning room, a technologist will review a safety questionnaire with you. We understand that this may seem redundant but your safety is our first priority. Once the technologist is assured that it is safe to proceed, he or she will escort you into the scanning room and help you get onto the MRI table. Once positioned, it is extremely important that you remain still during the examination. This will allow for clear images and will help us complete your test as quickly as possible.</p>';

Our check-in staff will ask you to complete registration forms that will allow us to collect your medical history and any necessary insurance information. One of our technologists will then escort you to the changing area and review your medical history.</p>\
<p>After changing into a gown, you will be brought into an ultrasonography room and positioned on a table in order to allow optimal visualization of the structures that are being evaluated.</p>\
<p>An ultrasound technologist will apply gel onto your skin in the area of interest and press firmly against the skin with an ultrasound transducer probe. The ultrasound technologist will move the probe along the skin in order to improve visualization and obtain the necessary images.</p>\
<p>Transvaginal or transrectal ultrasound exams in which the transducer probe is inserted into an opening of the body, such as the vagina or rectum, provide a closer look at internal structures and are usually well tolerated with minimal discomfort. Always notify the technologist if you experience any pain during an examination.</p>\
<p>Once the exam is complete, the gel is wiped off the skin and you will be asked to wait while the images are reviewed with the radiologist in order to ensure that all of the necessary information was obtained. In some cases, the physician may request additional images. We strive, however, to make your visit with us as quick and as pleasant as possible. Most ultrasound examinations take approximately 30 to 45 minutes.</p>';
