Meteoric Daisy Staff Client Design Spec, v1.0

1) Rationale/Overview
The staff app should be as straightforward to use as possible.
It shares a similar design with the patient client.

2) App Screens/States

Each tab is just a template that DOES NOT have parameterized routes.
rather, the appointment_id and physician_id's are passed as session variables.
"staff.appointment_id" and "staff.physician_id"

The first screen is already the obligation tab.
Tabs rely on session variables, as the meteoric implementatation current does not
support parameterized routes. Thus, the staff list uses the data attribute
to pass data to the event handlers, which set the relevant session variables
and then forward to the tab on success.

2) App Screens/States
	2.0 User Login Screen
	The staff log in screen shares the same screen with the patient's view.

	2.1 Index/Home Page
	Displays a list of the patient's upcoming appointments; each item
	contains a "right arrow" to switch to a details page. Additionally,
	appointments that contain an "update": the patient has updated their obligation
	list or posted a new message, will be colored blue.

	A search box is provided to let staff quickly search appointments by title,
	date, location, and organization.

	Transitions: 2.0, 2.2

	2.2 Appointment Details Page
	Provides:
		-A preparations tab that provides a read-only view of the patient's preparation list
		-A messages tab that displays the entire message log the patient has sent to the 
		staff.

	There is a back button to return to the appointment list.
	Transitions: 2.1, 2.2
